                 $1 Trillion Dollars’ Worth of Food Is Wasted Each Year
                </h1>
                <p >
                Approximately $1 trillion dollars’ worth of food is lost or wasted every year. This happens in the form of food loss – food that is damaged as it moves through the supply chain – and food waste – edible food that is thrown away by retailers or consumers.

According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), reversing this trend would preserve enough food to feed 2 billion people . That’s more than twice the number of undernourished people across the globe.

                <h1>Rich Countries Waste as Much Food as Sub-Saharan Africa Produces</h1>
                <p>According to the U.N. Environment Programme, industrialized countries in North America, Europe and Asia collectively waste 222 million tons of food each year. In contrast, countries in sub-Saharan Africa produce 230 million tons of food each year. That means sub-Saharan Africa’s food output is practically equal to the amount of food wasted by the world’s richest countries.</p>

            <h2 id="r"> Here's what you need to know:</h2>

<h5>1. One-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally. This amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year, worth approximately US$1 trillion.</h5>

<h5>2. All the food produced but never eaten would be sufficient to feed two billion people. That's more than twice the number of undernourished people across the globe.</h5>

<h5>3. If wasted food were a country, it would be the third-largest producer of carbon dioxide in the world, after the USA and China.</h5>

<h5>4. Consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa each year.</h5>

<h5>5. In developing countries, 40 per cent of losses occur at post-harvest and processing levels.</h5>
